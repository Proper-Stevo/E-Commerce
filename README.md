# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

This project was incredible, it really was a cultivation of back end to the fullest. A clear understanding of API's and how to use routes, and syntax values. 
This was a project that really opened the way to seeing bigger, this was a commerce website only in the backend. And going forward we are going to use this information to do both frontend and backend and makt it work seemlessly. This project had many missing key routes and the way we had to get to them. Getting the syntax was extremly important, and especially the key/category values in the right order to pull up what we wanted to display.

## Installation

The packages I had to install were MySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv package.
